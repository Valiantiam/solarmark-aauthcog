We are happy to have you here and explore having you join the corp!\n\n<@{}> is our CEO.\n<@{}> and <@{}> are our recruitment directors.\n\nWeâ€™re here to answer any questions you have about joining Solarmark.\n\nThe first step in this process will be to set yourself up in AAuth, which is our corporation management tool. This will allow us to take a look at your character(s) and also manages our other services that you'll interact with if you end up joining us.\n\n1. Go to https://aauth.solarmark.io/ and log in with your main character. Provide a valid email as well.\n2. Once logged in, on the dashboard, use the 'Add Character' button to add all your related characters.\n3. Once all characters are added, go to https://aauth.solarmark.io/member-audit/launcher and make sure all your characters are added there as well. If they are not, please manually add them via the 'Register' button.\n4. Still in Member Audit, confirm that all characters have the small white eye icon next to their name. If they do not, click the yellow eye button below their portrait. This gives Solarmark leadership access to view those characters.\n5. Go to https://aauth.solarmark.io/services/ and click the activate button for the Discord service. This will get your Discord account linked to your AAuth account for automated role management.\n\nIf you run into any issues, please message us here and we'll work through them with you.\n\nOnce the AAuth steps above are complete, our process generally is the following:\n1. Q/A back and forth here.\n2. Character(s) background check.\n3. Voice Comms Interview.\n4. Acceptance into corp, assuming everyone is a happy fit.\n\nLooking forward to getting to know each other, feel free to ask any questions and we will take turns responding as available, o7!".format(
